# House Price Prediction

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predicting house prices based on various features such as house size, number of rooms, location, and more. The model is built using the Linear Regression algorithm and achieves an accuracy of **84.5%** on the test dataset. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and extensively cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality predictions.

## Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values and removed outliers for better data quality.  
  - Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.  

- **Model Implementation:**  
  - Utilized the **Linear Regression** algorithm to build the predictive model.  
  - Splitted the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.  

- **Performance Evaluation:**  
  - Achieved a test accuracy of **84.5%** using the R-squared metric.  
  - Evaluated the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
